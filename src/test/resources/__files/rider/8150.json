Rins won the CEV in 2011 before moving up to the Moto3™ World Championship in 2012 and gaining the title of Rookie of the Year. A title contender down to the last corner in 2013 after more wins and podiums, the Spaniard was just beaten to the crown by compatriot Maverick Viñales. After a more difficult 2014 affected slightly by injury, Rins moved to Moto2™ for 2015 and was Rookie of the Year, taking wins in his debut season in the intermediate class. A title challenger in 2016, the former national Champion finished the season in third after more impressive wins and podiums, and moved up to MotoGP™ in 2017 with Team Suzuki Ecstar. Despite some trouble with injury and missed races, Rins was impressive and took some top five results as a rookie – a good springboard for his sophomore season. He went on to take five podiums in 2018 and consistently fight at the front; another solid foundation for 2019. The next step was made in 2019 as Rins claimed a maiden MotoGP™ victory at the Americas GP, before repeating the feat in Silverstone. 2020 was another outstanding year for the Spaniard as he claimed victory in the Aragon GP as well as podium finishes in the Catalan, Teruel and European GPs, helping him claim 3rd overall in the Championship. 2021 was a year to forget for Rins, with crashes at crucial times costing him dearly. He threw away opportunities on no fewer than six occasions, tasting podium success once at the British GP. The Spaniard will be desperate to bounce back in 2022.","media":{"video":null,"picture":"https://photos.motogp.com/riders/4/1/413ad512-9013-4a90-9b5f-06187e3a3379/biography/42_Alex_Rins_DSC7505.jpg"}},"legend":false,"legacy_id":8150,"merchandise_url":"https://store.motogp.com/en/alex-rins-42-merchandise?utm_source=motogp.com&utm_medium=Link&utm_content=AR12&utm_campaign=Store&o=motogp-riders-stats","published":true,"injured":false,"banned":false,"wildcard":false}
